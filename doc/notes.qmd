## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

#Editing R.file

```{r}
edit_r_profile()
```

#If it is a build dependency, it is an "import", if it is a workflow dependency it is a "suggest"

A good rule of thumb to determine whether a package is a build or a workflow dependency is:

-   If you write and use functions from the package within an R script that does something to the data or analysis, then it is likely a *build* dependency.

-   If you *only* ever use functions from the package in the Console, then it is probably a *workflow* dependency.
